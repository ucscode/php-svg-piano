## Introduction

The PHP SVG Piano Generator is a powerful, object-oriented library designed to dynamically create scalable vector graphic (SVG) representations of a piano. This library caters to web developers, music educators, and creative coders who need a customizable visual representation of a piano for their projects.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic SVG Generation:** Generate high-quality, fully scalable SVG graphics of a piano.
- **Customizable Design:** Tailor the piano's appearance by adjusting dimensions, key spacing, styling, and more.
- **Object-Oriented Architecture:** Utilize a modular design with dedicated classes to handle specific tasks such as musical note processing, key rendering, and layout management.
- **Pattern-Based Customization:** Modify how individual keys are rendered through pattern classes that handle various states (e.g., default, clicked, released).
- **Musical Accuracy:** Leverage the libraryâ€™s integration of musical theory with classes like `Pitch` and `Octave` for precise note mapping and organization.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Use the `Configuration` and `Option` classes to seamlessly set up rendering parameters and additional metadata, such as a piano title.

### Use Cases

- **Web Applications:** Embed an interactive piano in your website for musical education or entertainment.
- **Music Theory Projects:** Visualize musical concepts and note groupings with dynamically generated SVG pianos.
- **Creative Coding:** Integrate musical elements into art or multimedia projects that require a customizable and scalable piano graphic.

### Getting Started

The library is designed for ease of integration and rapid development. With a few lines of code, you can set up and render a piano tailored to your specific requirements.

In the following sections, we will dive into the library's core components, starting with the main `Piano` class, and then detailing the supportive classes and patterns that offer extensive customization options.
